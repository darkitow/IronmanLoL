# Ironman Challenge for LoL

The Ironman Challenge is designed to test the player's endurance and ability to play a variety of characters. Traditionally played on fighting games, this webapp helps bring the challenge to League of Legends!

The exact rules change depending on the game and player preference, so here's a few sugesstions:
1. Bronze - Win a game with every character in order, independent of any losses inbetween.
2. Silver - Win a game with every character in order, but any loss means you need to go back to the previous champion, with a checkpoint every new letter reached. 
3. Gold - Win a game with every character in order, but any loss means you need to go back to the previous champion. Testing not only your ability, but your consistency.
4. Platinum - Win a game with every character in order, but any loss means you to go back to the first champion of that letter.
5. Diamond - Win a game with every character in order, but every loss means you go back to the start. ~~(this is pretty much impossible)~~
